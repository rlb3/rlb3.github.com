      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Elixir recently, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying it. The
only other functional programming language I&amp;rsquo;ve used before is
Clojure. But now I understand recursion and state in a way that I
haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think of functional languages I about immutable data. And when
I reflect on immutable data I think about statelessness. Data goes in
a function a value comes out. I never thought about a pure function
holding state. Then I start reading about &lt;code&gt;Agents&lt;/code&gt; in Elixir and how
their purpose is to hold and modify state. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
understand. Everything I read said that Elixir&amp;rsquo;s data was immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I read there are no looping constructs in Elixir because of the
immutable data and because of that the only provided way to loop is
recursion. At first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the connection between these ideas,
but then it hit me. A function that receives data and passes that data
back in through a recursive call is maintaining state. I never thought
of this as a use for recursion. I used accumulators with recursion,
but the idea I was maintaining state just blew past me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example in Elixir of what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about:&lt;/p&gt;



defmodule Playground do
  def counter(current \\ 0) do
    receive do
      {:inc, pid} -&gt;
        send pid, current
        counter(current + 1)
    end
  end

  def start do
    spawn(Playground, :counter, [0])
  end
end



&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;iex(1)&amp;gt; pid = Playground.start

#PID&amp;lt;0.100.0&amp;gt;

iex(2)&amp;gt; send pid, {:inc, self()}

{:inc, #PID&amp;lt;0.98.0&amp;gt;}

iex(3)&amp;gt; flush

0 :ok

iex(4)&amp;gt; send pid, {:inc, self()}

{:inc, #PID&amp;lt;0.98.0&amp;gt;}

iex(5)&amp;gt; flush

1

:ok
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was my epiphany for the weekend. &lt;em&gt;Pure functions can maintain
state through recursion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
