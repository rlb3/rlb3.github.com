  <h1 class="headline" itemprop="headline">Recursion</h1>
  <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been studying Elixir recently and i&rsquo;ve really been enjoying
it. The only other functional programming language I&rsquo;ve used before is
Clojure. But after today, I understand recursion and state in a way
that I haven&rsquo;t thought about before.</p>

<p>When I think of functional languages I about immutable data. And when
I think about immutable data I think about statelessness. Data goes in
a function a values comes out. I never thought about a pure function
holding state. Then I start reading about <code>Agents</code> in Elixir and how
their purpose is to hold and provide access to modifying state. I
didn&rsquo;t understand. All the books said that Elixir data was
immutable.</p>

<p>Then I read something about the reason there was no looping
constructs in Elixir was because of the immutable state and because of
that recursion the way to loop. At first I didn&rsquo;t make the connection
between these ideas but then it hit me. A function that blocks to
receive data and passes that data back in through a recursive call is
maintaining state. I never thought of this as a use for recursion. I
used accumulators with recursion but the idea I was maintaining state
just blew pass me.</p>

<p>So that was my epiphany for the weekend. <em>Pure functions can maintain
stage through recursion</em>.</p>
